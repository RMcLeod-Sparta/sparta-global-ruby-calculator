<h1>Ruby calculator</h1>

##Development started with creating correct prompts to get the information,
##then getting the right result with those inputs as well as getting the
##correct number of inputs.

##At one point my calculations were not working as intended, this was because
##the numbers i was getting were strings. To fix this is amended my variables
##with ".to_f" to make them into floats.

##I made it so you only have to put one letters inputs into the prompt but this
##was a problem when comparing the inputs since for example you use s for
##subtraction and square root. I fixed this by making the statement compare
##the type of inputs you chose as well.
